# IEDCarte-BotDiscord

IED Carte is a bot initially designed to allow IED Paris 8 bachelor/master computer science students to share their geographical positions in order to potentially meet each other.
It uses the [Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J) and [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) library.
